## Getting Started

1. **Start the API server**:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. **Import the collection** into Insomnia

3. **Set up authentication**:
   - Use the "Login" request with your credentials
   - Copy the JWT token from the response
   - Set the `auth_token` environment variable

4. **Create an organization**:
   - Use the "Create Organization" request
   - Copy the organization ID from the response
   - Set the `organization_id` environment variable

5. **Start testing** the other endpoints!

## Authentication Flow

1. **Login** with your credentials to get a JWT token
2. **Set the `auth_token`** environment variable with the token
3. **All authenticated requests** will automatically include the Bearer token

## Example Workflow

1. **Login** → Get JWT token
2. **Create Organization** → Get organization ID
3. **Create Content Type** → Get content type ID
4. **Create Category** → Get category ID
5. **Create Tag** → Get tag ID
6. **Create Content** → Get content ID
7. **Publish Content** → Make content public
8. **Test Public endpoints** → Verify public access

## Content Filtering

The content endpoints support various query parameters:

- `contentTypeId` - Filter by content type
- `status` - Filter by status (DRAFT, PUBLISHED, ARCHIVED)
- `categoryId` - Filter by category
- `tagId` - Filter by tag
- `limit` - Number of items per page (default: 10)
- `offset` - Number of items to skip (default: 0)

## File Upload

For media uploads:
1. Use the "Upload File" request
2. Select a file in the request body
3. The file will be uploaded and you'll get a media ID

## Public API

The public endpoints don't require authentication and are designed for:
- Frontend applications
- Public content consumption
- SEO-friendly content access

All public endpoints require an `organizationSlug` parameter to filter content by organization.

## Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized**: Make sure you're logged in and the `auth_token` is set
- **403 Forbidden**: Check if your user has the required permissions
- **404 Not Found**: Verify the IDs in your environment variables
- **409 Conflict**: The resource already exists (e.g., duplicate slug)
